Below are compatible versions of required third-party 
libraries.

 	- git submodule init
 	- git submodule update
 * Create a MySQL database "openmonitor" respecting the credentials
   in settings.py.
 * Create a Cassandra key space named "openmonitor".
 * Start MySQL, Cassandra servers.
 * Do "python manage.py syncdb" and "python manage.py syncdb --database=mysql".
 * To enable tasks, start RabbitMQ server and do "python manage.py celeryd"
   to start messaging for tasks (OPTIONAL).
 * Start applciation with "python manage.py runserver".

FAQ :
 * When running "python manage.py syncdb" I get a stacktrace with the exception : "ImportError: No module named Signature". 
 	-	It means the version of pycrypto installed on your machine is not the right version. Run the following commands : "sudo apt-get install python-dev" to get Python development files (including Python.h) and then run the command "sudo pip install -I pycrypto==2.6.0"
 	- After this, you must be able to run syncdb command.
