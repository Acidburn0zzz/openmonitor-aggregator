For developers:

How to deploy it in AppEngine?

    1. Create an application in appspot.com
    2. change application name in app.yaml
    3. python manage.py deploy -e youremail@gmail.com

How to run locally?

$ python manager.py runserver

Links available to test the app:
 - http://icm-dev.appspot.com/map (show events on map)
 - http://icm-dev.appspot.com/realtimebox (show events on realtime box)

Everytime that a report is received in aggregator, a new event will be created, and both map and realtimebox are updated.
To test that functionality without agent, access the url http://icm-dev.appspot.com/api/tests - this method will send a "fake" report just for tests purpose.
