API
====
Everytime that a report is received in aggregator, a new event will be created, and both map and realtimebox are updated.
To test that functionality without agent, access the url http://icm-dev.appspot.com/api/tests - this method will send a "fake" report just for tests purpose.

Aggregator API:
 * /api/registeragent
